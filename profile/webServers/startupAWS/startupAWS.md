# Startup AWS

This startup just requires you to create your AWS web server and set up a DNS Route53 domain for your server.
The difficulty is that you need to follow the instructions with exactness.  
Typing in one wrong character can cause your server to not respond or to crash with an error.

Doing this will make this deliverable of your startup available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

## â˜‘ Assignment

1. [Set up your AWS acccount](https://learn.cs260.click/page/essentials/awsAccount/awsAccount_md) using your byu.edu email address. 
1. [Create a new EC2 instance](https://learn.cs260.click/page/webServers/amazonWebServicesEc2/amazonWebServicesEc2_md) and access the server using http://6.5.4.3 (where 6.5.4.3 is your IP address).
1. [Lease a domain](https://learn.cs260.click/page/webServers/amazonWebServicesRoute53/amazonWebServicesRoute53_md) in Route53.  Make sure you respond to the email that they will send you.
1. Make sure that you can access your server through HTTP through http://startup.yourdomain (where yourdomain is replaced with the domain you leased from Route53)
