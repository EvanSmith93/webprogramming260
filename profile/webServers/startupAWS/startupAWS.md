# Startup AWS

This startup just requires you to create your AWS web server and set up a DNS Route53 domain for your server.
You need to follow the instructions with exactness.  
Typing in one wrong character can cause your server to not respond or to crash with an error.

When you are finished, your startup will be available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.
