# Reactivity

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: `props`, `state`, and `render`.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's `state` or `prop` objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's `render` function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

The following example contains two components: a parent `<Survey/>` component and a child `<Question/>` component. The Survey has a state named `color`. The Question has a property named `answer`. The Survey passes its `color` state to the Question as a property. This means that any change to the Survey's color will also be reflected in the Question's color. This is a powerful means for a parent to control a child's functionality.

Be careful about your assumptions of when state is updated. Just because you called `updateState` does not mean that you can access the updated state on the next line of code. The update happens asynchronously, and therefore you never really know when it is going to happen. You only know that it will eventually happen.

```jsx
const Survey = () => {
  const [color, updateColor] = React.useState('#737AB0');

  // When the color changes update the state
  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateColor(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>

      {/* Pass the Survey color  as a parameter to the Question.
          When the color changes the Question parameter will also be updated and rendered. */}
      <Question answer={color} />

      <p>
        <span>Pick a color: </span>
        {/* Set the Survey color state as a the value of the color picker.
            When the color changes, the value will also be updated and rendered. */}
        <input type="color" onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} value={color} />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ answer }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Answer rerendered whenever the parameter changes */}
      <p>Your answer: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Survey />);
```

## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a fork of this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzYzXE) and experiment. Try changing the input from using the color and radio button, to using an edit box that reactively displays the text as you type.

_4 for this section of the course_: When you are done submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository `notes.md` with all of the things you learned and want to remember.

### ðŸ§§ Possible solution

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
const Survey = () => {
  const [text, updateText] = React.useState('');

  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateText(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      <Question answer={text} />

      <p>
        <span>Type some text: </span>
        <input type="text" onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} placeholder="type here" />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

const Question = ({ answer }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You typed: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
